# Name

The name "Ghibli" was chosen by Miyazaki from the Italian noun 'ghibli'(also used in English), the nickname of Itali's Saharan scouting plane Caproni Ca.309, in turn derived from the Italianization of the Libyan arabic name for a hot desert wind (qibliyy). The name was chosen by Miyazaki due to his passion for aircraft and for the idea that the studio would "blow a new wind through the anime industry". Although the Italian word would be more accurately transliterated as "Giburi", with a hard g sound, the studio's name is written in Japanese as 'Jiburi'.
