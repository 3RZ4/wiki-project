# About Me

Hi! My name is Erza, I'm 22 years old and originally from Kosovo, but born and living in Belgium. I've always loved Studio Ghiblie movies for their beautiful animation, creativity, and emotional stories. This Wiki is a small way for me to share my appreciation for the magical worlds created by Studio Ghibli.

This is a new paragraph to test out a new feature we're currently working on. Please be patient with us while we figure it out! :)
