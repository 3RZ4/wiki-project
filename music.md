# Music

Much of Studio Ghibli's music is composed by Joe Hisaishi, who has worked with Miyazaki on creating the music for his films for over 30 years. He uses storyboard images, provided by Miyazaki, to create an image album, which is then used to build out the final soundtrack for the movie. The music has elements from Baroque counterpoint, jazz, and modal music to create the unique sound that many associate with both Hisaishi and Studio Ghibli. Early on, the music in the films was known for its eclectic, synth sound, before later moving to more motivic and melody-driven music. Especially present in earlier years, the music does not directly relate to the emotions and rythms happening on screen. Another defining feature is Hisaishi's unique use of leitmotif, rather than a singular song being associated with one character, the motif is the theme of the film. Hisaishi began using leitmotif in Ghibli films first in Howl's moving Castle.
